# Basic-LL-Implementation
For Jonah - Simple linked list implemented in C

I knocked up a basic implementation of a linear linked list for you to play around
with to get comfortable.

Most of it is my code, so the form might not be impeccable, but all works and should
give you a good idea of how LL's are managed.

If you run this from the command line, just use the executable a.exe (./a.exe).
